Designed by May, the installation introduced a series of monumental forms wrapped in Nordic Knots' Grand Butter colorway, expanding the brand's visual language with bold material expression and architectural clarity.\n\nThe activation functioned as both an atmospheric intervention and a tactile exploration of form, color, and scale.

Designed as a platform for creative expression and social impact, the festival blended large-scale artistic programming with high-profile musical performances, with proceeds supporting the Downtown Women's Center.\n\nMay curated a central exhibition featuring over 100 works by female-identifying artists, including Susan Cianciolo, Zoe Latta, Laurie Simmons, Kiki Smith, Martine Syms, and Kandis Williams. The installation served as the cultural spine of the festival, situating visual art alongside performances by Lykke Li, Courtney Love, Cat Power, Megan Thee Stallion, Sophie, Kelsey Lu, and more.\n\nIn addition to curatorial direction, May worked on experiential elements throughout the park — helping shape vendor partnerships, spatial planning, and the event's overall visual and conceptual identity. The result was a multidimensional experience that positioned Yola Mezcal at the center of a meaningful, cross-disciplinary cultural moment.",

On view from December 9–11, 2022, the show featured 40 rare black-and-white film portraits taken between 1974 and 1986 — including never-before-seen images from Warhol's archive.\n\nThe photographs captured intimate, offhand moments from Warhol's life, offering a quiet glimpse into his creative orbit. Subjects included friends and collaborators such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, William S. Burroughs, Bianca Jagger, and others — each frame revealing the textured social and artistic network that defined Warhol's later years.\n\nAs the first exhibition staged at SIZED STUDIO, In Motion served as both cultural artifact and conceptual anchor — exploring the flow of inspiration through movement, community, and creative process.",

Staged in Los Angeles, the activation marked a shift in how USM could be positioned — less as a utilitarian system, and more as a flexible medium for creative expression.\n\nMay commissioned and art-directed a series of custom furniture pieces designed by Willo Perron, strategically placing USM's modular forms in dialogue with sculptural works, objects, and site-specific design elements. The resulting space functioned as both product showcase and curatorial platform — blending commerce, culture, and concept into a unified experience.\n\nPresented under the SIZED SELECTS banner, the project brought together collaborators across art, fashion, and design, drawing a crowd of influential voices while introducing new narratives around the USM brand.",

The initiative focused on reintroducing the historic space to the public through a series of curated exhibitions and activations.\n\nOver a six-month period, May curated eight distinct projects featuring both emerging and established designers. Each installation was conceived in direct dialogue with the building's architecture, honoring its modernist legacy while drawing new audiences into its orbit. Positioned to be visible from all sides of the building, the exhibitions reactivated Torre Velasca as a contemporary cultural destination in the heart of Milan.",

Lacquered in cerlacca — a deep red reminiscent of sealing wax — the chair adopted a high-gloss finish that brought warmth and tension to its otherwise austere composition. The result was an object that moved beyond function: a sculptural artifact shaped by geography, friendship, and shared language across Los Angeles and Milan.\n\nWhat began as a conversation between friends evolved into a meditation on movement — both literal and emotional — and the ways in which design can hold and reflect that experience.",

The experience began with a daytime viewing window for private clients, followed by an evening dinner hosted for key stakeholders and cultural figures.\n\nEach element of the event was conceived as part of a unified spatial narrative, drawing from Lemaire's utilitarian elegance. The studio was reimagined through an industrial lens: clothing was presented on steel-framed decking and minimalist pipe structures, softened by custom slipcovers and cushions in tones pulled from the collection's palette. Ikebana-style floral arrangements and hand-thrown vessels by local artisans added a sculptural counterpoint to the structured display.\n\nThe dinner featured a seasonal, seafood-forward menu and was staged on a table constructed from steel decking, with textiles echoing the visual language of the collection. Through material restraint and spatial rhythm, the event created a dialogue between clothing, environment, and experience.",
