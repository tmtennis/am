    summary: "Immersive installation transforming New York flagship with sculptural forms",
    description: "May partnered with Nordic Knots to create GRAND VOLUMES â€” an immersive installation that transformed the brand's New York flagship into a sculptural, site-specific experience. Designed by May, the installation introduced a series of monumental forms wrapped in Nordic Knots' Grand Butter colorway, expanding the brand's visual language with bold material expression and architectural clarity.\n\nThe activation functioned as both an atmospheric intervention and a tactile exploration of form, color, and scale. A curated selection of works from Magen H Gallery was also featured throughout the space, layering historical craftsmanship into the contemporary landscape.",
