NORDIC KNOTS,"Alexander May Studio conceived Grand Volumes for Nordic Knots, an immersive installation that transformed the brand’s New York flagship into a sculptural, site-specific environment. The project introduced a series of monumental forms wrapped in the Grand Butter colourway, extending the brand’s language through material intensity and architectural clarity.

The installation operated simultaneously as an atmospheric intervention and a study in form, colour, and scale. To deepen the spatial dialogue, a curated selection of works from Magen H Gallery was integrated, layering historical craftsmanship within a contemporary framework.",Creative Direction,Curated Collaboration,Set Design & Spatial Storytelling,,
WARHOL FOUNDATION,"In Motion: Andy Warhol 1974–1986
Alexander May Studio curated In Motion: Andy Warhol 1974–1986, a three-day photography exhibition presented at SIZED Studio in Los Angeles in collaboration with The Andy Warhol Foundation. On view from December 9–11, 2022, the exhibition featured 40 rare black-and-white film portraits taken between 1974 and 1986, including never-before-seen works from Warhol’s archive.

The photographs documented offhand and intimate moments from Warhol’s life, portraying friends and collaborators such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, William S. Burroughs, and Bianca Jagger. Each frame revealed the layered social and artistic network surrounding Warhol during his later years.
As the first exhibition staged at SIZED Studio, In Motion functioned as both cultural document and conceptual anchor, examining the flow of influence through movement, community, and creativ",Curation,Creative Direction,Spatial Storytelling,,
USM HALLER,"USM Modular Haller
Alexander May Studio collaborated with USM Modular Furniture on a custom installation and public program in Los Angeles, re-examining the brand’s design language through a contemporary lens. The project shifted perception of USM from purely utilitarian system to flexible medium for creative expression.

The studio commissioned and art-directed custom furniture pieces by Willo Perron, situating USM’s modular forms in dialogue with sculptural works, objects, and site-specific interventions. The resulting space functioned both as product showcase and as curatorial platform, merging commerce, concept, and environment into a unified experience.

Presented under the SIZED Selects banner, the project convened collaborators from across art, fashion, and design, drawing a critical audience while introducing new narratives around the possibilities of the USM system.",Creative Direction,Spatial Storytelling,Curation,Product Design,
TORRE VELESCA,"Torre Velasca — UNIPOL
Alexander May Studio collaborated with UNIPOL’s real estate development team to reimagine the ground floor of Torre Velasca, the landmark BBPR-designed skyscraper in Milan. The initiative reintroduced the historic space to the public through a program of curated exhibitions and activations.

Over six months, the studio curated eight distinct projects with both emerging and established designers. Each installation was conceived in direct dialogue with the building’s architecture, acknowledging its modernist legacy while inviting new audiences into its orbit.

Positioned to be visible from all sides of the tower, the exhibitions reactivated Torre Velasca as a contemporary site of engagement in the centre of Milan.",Creative Direction,Spatial Storytelling,Curation,,
STUDIOETTE,"001ert x SIZED
Alexander May Studio collaborated with Patrizio Gola and Guglielmo Giagnotti of Studioutte on a special edition of the studio’s ert chair,  a design rooted in formal rigour and graphic simplicity, echoing the structural vocabulary of De Stijl.

Reinterpreted through the lens of travel, abstraction, and exchange, the edition titled 001 ert x SIZED adopted a high-gloss cerlacca lacquer, a deep red reminiscent of sealing wax. This surface treatment introduced warmth and tension to the otherwise austere composition, shifting the chair beyond function into the realm of sculptural artifact.

What began as a dialogue between friends became a meditation on movement, literal and emotional, and on how design can embody geography, friendship, and shared language across Los Angeles and Milan.",Product Design,Curation,Creative Direction,,
PIERRE AUGUSTIN ROSE,"Pierre Augustin Rose, Art Basel Paris
Alexander May Studio collaborated with Paris-based atelier Pierre Augustin Rose on an immersive installation for Art Basel Paris, transforming the showroom into a gallery-like environment. The project placed the atelier’s upholstered furniture in dialogue with painting and atmosphere, reframing the space as a site of encounter between disciplines.

Marking Alexander May’s return to painting after a five-year hiatus, the installation featured hand-painted canvases interacting directly with the furniture, offering a contemporary reinterpretation of classic forms. Floor-to-ceiling high-gloss vinyl curtains enveloped the room, heightening cohesion and immersion.

The project was expanded through curated works by Galerie Peter Kilchmann, Galerie Chenel, Beck & Eggeling International Fine Art, Paul Sepuya, Manolo Valdés, Victor Guedy, Jonathan Binet, and Graham Hamilton, extending the installation into a broader dialogue between art and design.",Creative Direction,Spatial Storytelling,"

NM3,"NM3 — NMAM_CORE Daybed
Alexander May Studio collaborated with Milan-based design practice NM3 to create the NMAM_CORE daybed, a sculptural piece balancing industrial materiality with quiet restraint. Fabricated in mirrored polished and brushed stainless steel, with a black powder-coated edition forthcoming, the design was conceived as both a site of rest and an object of reflection.

The daybed debuted during Milan Fashion Week SS25 within an immersive installation at NM3’s headquarters, conceived and designed by the studio. The presentation recontextualised a selection of NM3 works within a minimal, atmospheric environment, reinforcing a shared visual language between May and the designers.

The NMAM_CORE daybed is available through NM3 and Basic.Space.",Product Design,Creative Direction,"Spatial Storytelling

DRIES VAN NOTEN,"Dries Van Noten — BOND
Alexander May Studio was invited by Dries Van Noten to curate BOND, a two-month exhibition at the brand’s Los Angeles arts space, and to redesign the adjacent retail store. Drawing from the Japanese art of Ikebana, the project examined spatial harmony, negative space, and the emotional resonance of placement.

For the exhibition, the studio curated objects and works from diverse collaborators, arranging them in layered compositions that reflected Ikebana’s principles of balance, tension, and restraint. In parallel, the retail store was reimagined to mirror the exhibition’s sensibility, enabling visitors to move seamlessly between commerce and display within a unified visual and conceptual environment.

Beyond curation and spatial design, the studio oversaw all print and digital collateral, ensuring a cohesive narrative across every touchpoint. The project concluded with a weeklong celebration produced in collaboration with Yola Mezcal and Aplós, bringing together creative communities across fashion, design, and art.","Creative Direction

BOCCI,"Bocci — 14p Launch
Alexander May Studio led the creative direction and production for the debut of the 14p, the first portable edition of Bocci’s iconic 14 series. Extending a design originally introduced in 2005, the 14p introduced new mobility and intimacy into Bocci’s sculptural lighting language.

The campaign combined still life and lifestyle photography with an intimate launch event, each element conceived to emphasise the object’s material presence, scale, and function. Through spatial framing and visual restraint, the studio crafted a launch experience that amplified the light’s impact across both physical and digital environments.",Creative Direction,"Spatial Storytelling

DIAGEO,"Mortlach by Design Lounge
Alexander May partnered with Mortlach Whisky to conceive and produce the Mortlach by Design Lounge, an immersive brand environment staged for the debut of Mortlach’s design collaborations. The project coincided with May’s third curatorial exhibition, INDUSTRIALISM, presented during NYCxDesign and Frieze Week, and centred around a private dinner for over 100 VIP guests.

Hosted at the Stephan Weiss Studio in collaboration with Donna Karan’s UrbanZen, the space combined Mortlach’s design objects with works by artists and designers from the exhibition. Swedish brand Bolon provided custom flooring, adding to the layered material narrative.

The experience culminated in a launch event for more than 500 guests, where hospitality, spatial design, and product storytelling were unified in a single architectural environment conceptualised and realised by May.",Creative Direction,Spatial Storytelling,Curated Collaborations,Installation & Production Design,
FONDAZIONE CONVERSO,"Fondazione Converso — Locatelli Partners
Alexander May Studio collaborated with Milan-based architectural firm Locatelli Partners to reimagine San Paolo Converso, a 16th-century church in the centre of Milan, as Fondazione Converso, a foundation for contemporary art. The studio developed the visual and conceptual identity for the institution, directing its campaigns to position the space as a destination rooted equally in history and innovation.

At the core of the project was a curatorial program led by the studio, commissioning site-specific installations from international artists and performers. Each intervention transformed the church into a living dialogue between architectural legacy and contemporary expression.

The initiative extended into philanthropic partnerships with cultural and fashion institutions including David Yurman, Vogue Italia, Off-White, BMW, and the Wall Street Journal, reinforcing the foundation as a platform for experimentation and engagement across art, design, and society.",Creative Direction,Spatial Storytelling,Curated Collaborations,,
