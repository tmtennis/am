PROJECT,DESCRIPTION,STACK
Nordic Knots,"May partnered with Nordic Knots to create GRAND VOLUMES — an immersive installation that transformed the brand’s New York flagship into a sculptural, site-specific experience. Designed by May, the installation introduced a series of monumental forms wrapped in Nordic Knots’ Grand Butter colorway, expanding the brand’s visual language with bold material expression and architectural clarity.

The activation functioned as both an atmospheric intervention and a tactile exploration of form, color, and scale. A curated selection of works from Magen H Gallery was also featured throughout the space, layering historical craftsmanship into the contemporary landscape.",PRODUCT DESIGN / CREATIVE DIRECTION / SET DESIGN & SPATIAL STORYTELLING / CURATED COLLABORATION
Zara,"May designed the set for a ZARA campaign inspired by classical ballet aesthetics. In collaboration with Vanessa Beecroft and dancers from the New York City Ballet, the shoot reinterpreted traditional stagecraft through a minimalist lens.

May scouted and transformed a historic nonprofit performance venue in New York into a black box theater, creating a refined spatial environment that amplified the collection’s sculptural silhouettes and choreography. The result was a quietly dramatic setting that honored movement, discipline, and restraint.",CREATIVE DIRECTION / SET DESIGN
Yola Mezcal,"May served as creative consultant for the inaugural Yola Día Music Festival, a landmark, all-women music and arts event held at Los Angeles State Historic Park. Designed as a platform for creative expression and social impact, the festival blended large-scale artistic programming with high-profile musical performances, with proceeds supporting the Downtown Women’s Center.

May curated a central exhibition featuring over 100 works by female-identifying artists, including Susan Cianciolo, Zoe Latta, Laurie Simmons, Kiki Smith, Martine Syms, and Kandis Williams. The installation served as the cultural spine of the festival, situating visual art alongside performances by Lykke Li, Courtney Love, Cat Power, Megan Thee Stallion, Sophie, Kelsey Lu, and more.

In addition to curatorial direction, May worked on experiential elements throughout the park — helping shape vendor partnerships, spatial planning, and the event’s overall visual and conceptual identity. The result was a multidimensional experience that positioned Yola Mezcal at the center of a meaningful, cross-disciplinary cultural moment.",CREATIVE DIRECTION / SET DESIGN & SPATIAL STORYTELLING / CURATED COLLABORATIONS
Vans,"May designed a private dinner in Los Angeles to celebrate the launch of the Clash the Wall sneakers — a capsule collection marking Sterling Ruby’s first fashion collaboration beyond Raf Simons. The event was created on behalf of OTW by Vans and S.R. STUDIO. LA. CA., and brought together a select group of cultural figures for an intimate evening that bridged fashion, art, and skateboarding.

Catered by French culinary collective We Are Ona, the dinner honored the collection’s experimental spirit while grounding it in community and craft. Guests included icons from the skate world such as Tony Alva and Atiba Jefferson, alongside artists, designers, and cultural leaders across disciplines.",CREATIVE DIRECTION / SET DESIGN & SPATIAL STORYTELLING / LAUNCH ACTIVATION & EVENT DESIGN / CURATED COLLABORATION
Warhol Foundation,"Curated by May, In Motion: Andy Warhol 1974–1986 was a three-day photography exhibition presented exclusively at SIZED STUDIO in Los Angeles, in collaboration with The Andy Warhol Foundation. On view from December 9–11, 2022, the show featured 40 rare black-and-white film portraits taken between 1974 and 1986 — including never-before-seen images from Warhol’s archive.

The photographs captured intimate, offhand moments from Warhol’s life, offering a quiet glimpse into his creative orbit. Subjects included friends and collaborators such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, William S. Burroughs, Bianca Jagger, and others — each frame revealing the textured social and artistic network that defined Warhol’s later years.

As the first exhibition staged at SIZED STUDIO, In Motion served as both cultural artifact and conceptual anchor — exploring the flow of inspiration through movement, community, and creative process.",CURATED COLLABORATIONS / CREATIVE DIRECTION / SET DESIGN & SPATIAL STORYTELLING
USM Modular Furniture,"May partnered with USM Modular Furniture to create a custom installation and public program that explored the brand’s design language through a contemporary cultural lens. Staged in Los Angeles, the activation marked a shift in how USM could be positioned — less as a utilitarian system, and more as a flexible medium for creative expression.

May commissioned and art-directed a series of custom furniture pieces designed by Willo Perron, strategically placing USM’s modular forms in dialogue with sculptural works, objects, and site-specific design elements. The resulting space functioned as both product showcase and curatorial platform — blending commerce, culture, and concept into a unified experience.

Presented under the SIZED SELECTS banner, the project brought together collaborators across art, fashion, and design, drawing a crowd of influential voices while introducing new narratives around the USM brand.",CREATIVE DIRECTION / PRODUCT DESIGN / SET DESIGN & SPATIAL STORYTELLING / CURATED COLLABORATIONS
Torre Velasca,"May partnered with UNIPOL’s real estate development team to reimagine the ground floor of Torre Velasca — the iconic BBPR-designed skyscraper in Milan — as a renewed site for cultural engagement. The initiative focused on reintroducing the historic space to the public through a series of curated exhibitions and activations.

Over a six-month period, May curated eight distinct projects featuring both emerging and established designers. Each installation was conceived in direct dialogue with the building’s architecture, honoring its modernist legacy while drawing new audiences into its orbit. Positioned to be visible from all sides of the building, the exhibitions reactivated Torre Velasca as a contemporary cultural destination in the heart of Milan.

Studioutte,"May partnered with Patrizio Gola and Guglielmo Giagnotti of Studioutte to create a special edition of the studio’s wooden ert chair — a piece rooted in strict formalism and graphic simplicity, nodding to the structural vocabulary of De Stijl.

This collaborative version, titled 001 ert x SIZED, reimagined the original chair through the lens of travel, abstraction, and personal exchange. Lacquered in cerlacca — a deep red reminiscent of sealing wax — the chair adopted a high-gloss finish that brought warmth and tension to its otherwise austere composition. The result was an object that moved beyond function: a sculptural artifact shaped by geography, friendship, and shared language across Los Angeles and Milan.

What began as a conversation between friends evolved into a meditation on movement — both literal and emotional — and the ways in which design can hold and reflect that experience.",PRODUCT DESIGN / CURATED COLLABORATIONS / CREATIVE DIRECTION
SSense,"May directed and designed a dual-part activation to launch SSENSE’s FW23 Lemaire Exclusive Capsule Collection. The experience began with a daytime viewing window for private clients, followed by an evening dinner hosted for key stakeholders and cultural figures.

Each element of the event was conceived as part of a unified spatial narrative, drawing from Lemaire’s utilitarian elegance. The studio was reimagined through an industrial lens: clothing was presented on steel-framed decking and minimalist pipe structures, softened by custom slipcovers and cushions in tones pulled from the collection’s palette. Ikebana-style floral arrangements and hand-thrown vessels by local artisans added a sculptural counterpoint to the structured display.

The dinner featured a seasonal, seafood-forward menu and was staged on a table constructed from steel decking, with textiles echoing the visual language of the collection. Through material restraint and spatial rhythm, the event created a dialogue between clothing, environment, and experience.",CREATIVE DIRECTION / SET DESIGN & SPATIAL STORYTELLING / INSTALLATION & PRODUCTION DESIGN / CURATED COLLABORATION / LAUNCH ACTIVATION & EVENT DESIGN
Skims,"Over several years, May worked in close collaboration with Vanessa Beecroft and the SKIMS creative team to lead the creative direction and set design for a series of high-profile campaigns — including the launches of SKIMS’ vegan leather and core shapewear collections.

Through sculptural staging and spatial precision, May helped translate Beecroft’s signature visual language into immersive campaign worlds that bridged performance, installation, and commercial storytelling. The work centered the female form with clarity and restraint, positioning SKIMS at the intersection of fashion and contemporary art.

Featured talent across campaigns included Kim Kardashian, Kim Cattrall, Nelly Furtado, Hari Nef, and Lana Condor. The visuals were distributed globally across SKIMS’ platforms, reinforcing the brand’s cultural impact through a consistently refined aesthetic.",CREATIVE DIRECTION / SET DESIGN
Salone Del Mobile,"For Salone del Mobile, May collaborated with architect and designer Antonio Forteleoni on a weeklong installation spanning the windows of Forteleoni’s Milan studio. The exhibition featured seven new sculptural works, presented in a continuously shifting lightscape that transitioned from dusk to dawn over 168 hours of uninterrupted visibility.

Conceived as a porous and interactive environment, the installation invited passersby to engage with the space at all hours — dissolving the boundaries between public and private, viewer and participant. The project emphasized material presence, repetition, and architectural rhythm, bringing sculptural form into quiet dialogue with the city.

PIN UP Magazine,"May curated and launched New Wave, a virtual exhibition developed in partnership with PIN–UP Magazine, spotlighting the work of 31 artists and makers from across North America. The project explored the breadth of contemporary American design, offering a snapshot of material innovation and cultural perspective within the field.

To celebrate the launch, May designed and hosted an exclusive in-person event at Sunset in collaboration with EDITION Hotels. The activation translated the virtual exhibition into a physical environment — bridging digital and spatial formats through a curated gathering that emphasized intimacy, texture, and context.

This hybrid approach expanded the exhibition’s reach while reinforcing its cultural resonance, offering both access and atmosphere in equal measure.

Pierre Augustin Rose,"May collaborated with Paris-based atelier Pierre Augustin Rose to create an immersive showroom installation during Art Basel Paris, merging his artistic sensibilities with the brand’s iconic upholstered furniture collection. The project transformed the atelier’s Paris showroom into a gallery-like space — a refined intersection of painting, design, and atmosphere.

Marking May’s return to painting after a five-year hiatus, the installation featured hand-painted canvases that adorned and interacted with the furniture, offering a contemporary reinterpretation of classic forms. The space was enveloped in floor-to-ceiling high-gloss vinyl curtains, creating a cohesive and immersive environment.

The installation also included curated works from Galerie Peter Kilchmann, Galerie Chenel, Beck & Eggeling International Fine Art, Paul Sepuya, Manolo Valdés, Victor Guedy, Jonathan Binet, and Graham Hamilton — extending the project into a broader cultural dialogue.

NM3,"May partnered with Milan-based design studio NM3 to create the NMAM_CORE daybed — a sculptural piece that balances industrial materiality with quiet restraint. Fabricated in two finishes, mirrored polished and brushed stainless steel (with a black powder-coated edition forthcoming), the design invites both rest and reflection.

The daybed debuted during Milan Fashion Week SS25 through an immersive installation at NM3’s headquarters, conceived and designed by May. The space featured a curated selection of NM3 products recontextualized within a minimal, atmospheric environment — drawing a strong turnout and reinforcing the shared visual language between May and the studio.

The NMAM_CORE daybed is available via NM3 and Basic.Space.","PRODUCT DESIGN / CREATIVE DIRECTION / SET DESIGN & SPATIAL STORYTELLING / CURATED COLLABORATION

Nardone Automotive,"May designed the environment for the U.S. premiere of Nardone Automotive’s bespoke Porsche GT — a bold reinterpretation of the classic 928 model. Hosted at SIZED STUDIO in Los Angeles, the event space was conceived as a spatial extension of the car’s identity: industrial, sculptural, and meticulously composed.

To frame the vehicle, May created a series of custom display elements and visual cues that echoed the car’s proportions and material palette. Art and design objects were curated to punctuate the space, reinforcing a narrative of precision, craftsmanship, and cultural relevance.

Rather than presenting the Porsche GT in isolation, the experience unfolded as an immersive installation — one that invited guests into a controlled visual world where performance design met contemporary aesthetics. Every detail was considered to heighten the object’s impact and elevate the brand’s position within a broader design conversation.

Matches,"May collaborated with Matches to present VESSELS, an exhibition staged during Frieze Los Angeles that explored the relationship between contemporary craft and luxury fashion. The show featured twelve vessels by emerging artists and designers, curated and placed in dialogue with Matches' brand universe to create a thoughtful convergence of art, design, and commerce.

Staged at Frieze’s main venue and viewed by over 30,000 attendees, the exhibition blended material storytelling with digital experimentation. In partnership with Paris-based NFT company Concept, VESSELS was among the first to merge physical objects with NFT technology — linking innovation to tradition through form.

To deepen the cultural dialogue, May also hosted an exclusive VIP event and conversation within the space, focusing on the evolving intersection of art, design, and digital culture.",CREATIVE DIRECTION / SET DESIGN & SPATIAL STORYTELLING / CURATED COLLABORATIONS
Highsnobiety ,"May starred in and produced a content campaign in collaboration with Highsnobiety, covering product by lighting manufacturer, Bocci. The shoot featured May in his studio, engaging with the piece in an intimate, real-life setting — positioning the object within the context of lived design.

The campaign included both photo and video assets and was conceived to reflect Bocci’s sensibility through a personal, editorial lens. Published across Highsnobiety’s digital platforms, the content offered a quiet, sculptural narrative that aligned material design with cultural storytelling.

Gallery Fumi,"May partnered with London-based Gallery FUMI to lead the gallery’s strategic expansion into the Los Angeles market through a month-long pop-up exhibition. The project was developed to build brand visibility, establish cultural credibility, and connect the gallery with LA’s creative landscape in a meaningful way.

May directed the overall campaign strategy and curated a series of brand-aligned activations in collaboration with key cultural partners including Cultured Magazine, The Downtown LA Proper, and Yola Mezcal. Programming included a private preview, a rooftop party at the Proper, and an intimate dinner at Dahlia — timed to celebrate Max Lamb’s first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in years.

In addition to shaping the gallery’s presence in LA, May oversaw the design of all marketing and visual materials for the campaign, ensuring a cohesive brand experience that resonated with both longtime FUMI collectors and a new West Coast audience.",EXPERIENTIAL DESIGN / CURATED COLLABORATION
Fondazione Converso,"May collaborated with Milan-based architectural firm Locatelli Partners to reimagine Vincent Paolo Converso, a 16th-century church in the heart of Milan, as a new foundation for contemporary art named Fondazione Converso. He developed the visual and conceptual identity for the space, directing its advertising and marketing campaigns to position it as a cultural destination rooted in both history and innovation.

Central to the project was a curatorial program led by May, who collaborated with artists and performers from around the world to produce site-specific installations. These works transformed the church into a living dialogue between architectural legacy and contemporary expression.

The initiative also included philanthropic partnerships with global cultural and fashion institutions including David Yurman, Vogue Italia, Off-White, BMW, and the Wall Street Journal — helping shape the space as a platform for both creative experimentation and social engagement.",CREATIVE DIRECTION / SET DESIGN & SPATIAL STORYTELLING / CURATED COLLABORATIONS
Dries Van Noten,"Dries Van Noten invited May to curate BOND, a two-month exhibition at the brand’s Los Angeles arts space, and to redesign the interior of the adjacent retail store. Inspired by the Japanese art of Ikebana, the project explored spatial harmony, negative space, and the emotional resonance of placement.

For the exhibition, May curated a selection of objects and works from various collaborators, creating layered arrangements that reflected Ikebana’s core principles of balance, tension, and restraint. Simultaneously, the retail space was reimagined to mirror the exhibition’s sensibility — allowing visitors to move fluidly between the store and the show within a cohesive visual and conceptual environment.

In addition to curating the exhibition and styling the store, May oversaw all print and digital marketing collateral to ensure a unified narrative across every touchpoint. The project culminated in a final week celebration produced in collaboration with Yola Mezcal and Aplós, bringing together creative communities across fashion, design, and art.",CREATIVE DIRECTION / CURATED COLLABORATION / EXHIBITION & ART SHOW CURATION / INTERIOR STYLING & VISUAL STRATEGY / LAUNCH ACTIVATION & EVENT DESIGN

The campaign included still life and lifestyle photography, alongside an intimate launch event — each element designed to emphasize the object’s material presence, scale, and functionality. Through spatial framing and visual restraint, May crafted a launch experience that extended the object’s impact across both physical and digital environments.",CREATIVE DIRECTION / EXPERIENTIAL DESIGN / ART DIRECTION & VISUAL STRATEGY
