SIZED PREVIEW
"Founded by Alexander May, SIZED is a curatorial platform and cultural studio dedicated to staging exhibitions and presenting collectible design. Operating at the intersection of art, design, and commerce, SIZED connects brands, artists, and creative communities through thoughtfully conceived environments and immersive experiences.

Working nomadically, SIZED identifies and activates distinctive real estate, historic properties, vacant retail spaces, and architectural landmarks, to create site-specific exhibitions and brand moments that resonate culturally and commercially. Each project foregrounds considered curation and spatial storytelling, with a focus on context, placement, and the evolving role of collectible design in contemporary culture.

From 2022 to 2024, SIZED operated SIZED STUDIO, a converted 7,000-square-foot theater in Los Angeles that served as a cultural anchor for multidisciplinary exhibitions, collaborations, and brand partnerships, situated alongside galleries such as David Zwirner, Clearing, and Ch√¢teau Shatto.

Today, SIZED continues to curate exhibitions and produce cultural activations that bring together innovative brands, influential creatives, and architectural spaces, shaping meaningful narratives around art, design, and objects of lasting value."
